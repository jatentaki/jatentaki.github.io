I hold a BSc in Chemistry from the [University of Warsaw](http://en.uw.edu.pl/) and I am doing my MSc thesis in [Computational Science and Engineering](https://cse.epfl.ch/) at [EPFL](https://epfl.ch/)'s [Computer Vision Laboratory](https://cvlab.epfl.ch/).

This page was created to showcase my projects, currently the [visualization of public transportation in Warsaw](https://jatentaki.github.io/ztm).
