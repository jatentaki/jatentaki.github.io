I'm Michał (pronounce as English "me" + "how") and I'm interested in computer perception, graphics and spatial reasoning. I'm about to graduate with a PhD in CS from EPFL on the topic of 3d computer vision. I also enjoy finding novel applications for established algorithms, for example in humanities.
